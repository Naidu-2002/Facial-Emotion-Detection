### Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- tensorflow (for ResNet-50 model)  
- opencv-python (for image processing)  
- numpy (for numerical operations)  
- flask (for creating the backend API)  
- Pillow (for image handling)  

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install them individually using:
